# White Paper: Metal Sheet-Based Logic Gates and Processor-Like System

## Abstract
This white paper presents an innovative computing system that implements fundamental logic gates (XOR, AND, OR, NOT) using stacked metal sheets (e.g., aluminum foil) with insulating and semi-conductive layers (e.g., paper, salt-water-soaked fabric) in small modular frames. By leveraging electrical conductivity, the system mimics digital logic operations, offering a low-cost, stable platform for educational, artistic, and experimental applications. Detailed instructions are provided for constructing each gate and synchronizing them to form a processor-like system. While impractical for traditional computing, this approach enables interdisciplinary exploration, environmental integration, and unconventional computing research, with significant potential for macro-scale implementations.

## Introduction
Conventional processors rely on silicon for speed and precision, but alternative substrates like stacked metal sheets can inspire novel computing paradigms, particularly where speed is not critical. This paper details a metal sheet-based system for logic gates, implemented in compact modular frames (15cm × 15cm), with potential to scale to macro systems (e.g., fields of interconnected grids). Instructions cover XOR, AND, OR, and NOT gates, plus synchronization methods to emulate processor functionality. Benefits include low cost, stability, and opportunities for education, art, and experimental computing.

## Benefits of a Macro-Scale Metal Sheet-Based System
A macro-scale system, such as a field of interconnected metal sheet grids, amplifies impact in non-traditional contexts. The following benefits highlight its advantages over soil-based systems and other alternatives:
