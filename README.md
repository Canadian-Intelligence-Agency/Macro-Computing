# Macro-Computing

Macro-Computing explores computing systems built using unconventional, large-scale materials and methods, diverging from traditional microelectronic circuits. This repository documents experimental approaches to constructing logic systems and processor-like architectures using physical, macro-scale mediums such as soil and metal sheets. The goal is to investigate alternative computing paradigms that leverage accessible, natural, or industrial materials for educational, theoretical, and practical exploration.

## Overview

Macro-Computing focuses on creating functional computational systems at a human-visible scale, where components like logic gates are constructed from materials like soil or metal sheets. These systems aim to replicate fundamental computing operations (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, NOT) and combine them into processor-like architectures. By using non-traditional materials, Macro-Computing offers insights into the principles of computation, material science, and sustainable technology.

## Whitepapers

### Soil-Based Logic Gates and Processor-Like System

This paper presents a soil-based computing system that implements fundamental logic gates (XOR, AND, OR, NOT) using layered soils with electrical inputs in small pottery pots. By leveraging soil conductivity, the system mimics digital logic operations and can be synchronized to form a rudimentary processor-like system. It explores applications in education, environmental integration, and unconventional computing research.
